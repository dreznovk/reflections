When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want to collaborate with other people or if i want to work from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be some commit on the remote repository by someone else that conflict with your own commit on your local which could cause code error.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone: Copy a respository from one location (local or remote) to another.
Forks: Clone on GitHub.
Branches: A different path for commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allow you to keep track of the changes in your file in relation with the last time you pull from remote repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would have to be in the same work space or in the same network as them to be able to collaborate effectively, the upside is that i will avoid conflict better and have better understanding of each other's work
